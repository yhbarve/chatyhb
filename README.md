## ChatYHB - An AI Chat Bot

ChatYHB is an AI chat bot that uses Google AI SDK. Currently, the app supports text-based prompts and responses. ChatYHB is powered by Google Gemini 1.5. Here are some of the key features:
- Login / Signup functionality
- User's previous conversations are saved
- User's can delete all of their previous conversations
- Response text is well formated for better UX

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React + JS + TailwindCSS
- Backend: NodeJS + Express
- Database: MongoDB

The following are some features that I am considering that can improve the application further:
- Better UI and animations
- Option to delete specific prompts and responses
- Code blocks support (the current version supports code blocks, but does not format it very well)
- Login / Sign Up with Google, Microsoft, etc. (NextAuth)

If you have any questions / feedback to provide, please reach out. I would love to talk! (Email: yhbarve@uwaterloo.ca)
